## Android Beacon Library

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library.png?circle-token=4e11fb0dccaa8b98bc67fdbe38b179e4a7d07c27)](https://circleci.com/gh/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library)

An Android library providing APIs to interact with beacons.  Please visit the
[project website](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/) for how to use this library.

**IMPORTANT: By default, this library will only detect beacons meeting the AltBeacon specification.**

If you want this library to work with proprietary or custom beacons, see the [BeaconParser](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/javadoc/org/altbeacon/beacon/BeaconParser.html) class.

### What does this library do?

It allows Android devices to use beacons much like iOS devices do.  An app can request to get notifications when one
or more beacons appear or disappear.  An app can also request to get a ranging update from one or more beacons
at a frequency of approximately 1Hz.
